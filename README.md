# HHA 507 Assignment 9 - AutoML

1. Create a new github repo called 'AutoML examples' 

2. Select a dataset of your own choosing (or select my modified version of SPARCS - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-507-2022/main/autoML/datasets/data_sparcs.csv) 

3. Create two 'experiments' using the autoML package mljar-supervised 
One that is focused around classification (binary or multi-class outcome variable)
One that is focused around regression (continuous outcome variable) 
4. Include the output of the mljar-supervised output folder inside of the github repo (e.g., so there should be 2 folders - one for classification and one for regression) 

5. In a markdown file (readme.md): 
    - Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline
